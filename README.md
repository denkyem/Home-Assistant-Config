# Home Assistant Config

This is my current configuration of Home Assistant.

I'll try to keep it up-to-date


# Notes

- Folder 'Views' keeps my Lovelace panels
- It needs to better organized, but is working for what I want/need so "if it's not broken..."
- Most automations are in Nodered, so they are not available here
